# on-NN-from-scratch
this is repository for creating library for  craetion of neural nets in Python programming language.

To-do:
1. introduce cross-entropy-loss;
2. implement backpropogation algorithm;
3. introduce drop-out mechanics;
4. implement matrix based approach to whole process of learnign;
